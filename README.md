Inter IIT 11.0 Mid-Prep Problem Statement

[Problem Statement](/Mid_JLR%20copy.pdf)

# TODO 
- [ ] Detect the location of the charging port on the vehicle
    - [ ] CCS2 plug detection
- [ ] Avoiding sharp bending angles for charging cable.
- [ ] Implement mechanical Constraints
    - [ ] Charger plugging operation speed should'nt exceed 0.1 m/s
    - [ ] Rotation Speed should not exceed 5 deg/sec

- [ ] Easy to change start and end pose of end-effector.
