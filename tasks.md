Jitendra, Kailash and Jugal
1. See how to import and simulate CAD model in Simscape
2. Try and get a generic robotic arm simulated in Simscape (UR5)

Kartikey, Ebrahim
1. How to get camera working in the simulation environment and how to process the camera data.
2. How to control the joint angles and speed of the robot in simulation environment.

Aditya, Raghu, Bhavya
1. Search for port detection and pose estimation algorithm using image.
2. Search for various ways in which the pose estimation of the port can be done.

MOM Query Session
1. could use RFID tags
2. CCS1 or CCS2 both are permissible
3. The position of the charger is to be decided.
4. what do you mean by using real video?
5. even a stick model is fine?
6. plugging maneuvour could be explicitly used.
7. 2019b if possible
8. Controller and controller algorithm should be mentioned.
9. 

## Questions 
1. Matlab version ? 
    * 2019b
2. Can we use ROS Simulink toolbox and gazebo simulator ? 
    * no constraint
3. Is there any constraint on cable length ? What is it's max bending radius or what is the max angle limit that it can tolerate ? What is the diameter of cable ?
    * no constraint on length, depends on the wire we chose
4. Can we use aruco tags ?
    * yes
5. What is the desired working range of robot ?
    * the whole bounding box
6. Location of bounding box with respect to the position from where cable starts ?
    * left on the team to decide.
7. Will you provide a car model ?
    * not required
